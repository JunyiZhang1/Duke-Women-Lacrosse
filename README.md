Duke Women’s Lacrosse Data Project (Ongoing)

•	Mined and structured massive data about player loads and health information of athletes in Duke Women’s Lacrosse Team by R; visualized the analysis results for each month and each player to help inform the in-season decision-making process.

•	Developed a “drill bank” that the coaches can use to plan practices with the correct level of intensity.

P.S. For confidentiality reasons, we are working on a Virtual Machine and cannot upload any codes or project details.
